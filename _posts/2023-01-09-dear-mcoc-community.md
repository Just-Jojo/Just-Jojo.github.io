# Dear MCOC community
Hallo there. If you don't know who I am and haven't heard about me firstly, congratulations, secondly you don't have to worry about this then. To people who know who I am I'm gonna talk about why I left and why I'm not coming back.

I joined the MCOC discord community in either 2019 or 2020 (I forgor which) and was not really that great a person (some can argue that I still am not a great person but they are wrong tbh imo fr). Over time I changed from being an annoying twat to being a somewhat less annoying, gay twat thanks to the people there. The people on both the UMCOC discord server and the SMS server (redundancy is fun fr) have helped me grow and gain a new perspective on stuff I had blindly followed my entire life. They've also helped me through tough times in my life and I am forever greatful for that. (Sentimental bastard fr)

The amount of people I've gotten to know, be friends with, and make memories with is quite unfathomable and I am thankful for each and everyone I got to meet because we played some shitty Marvel mobile game.

Now for the reason why I left!
I quit playing MCOC at the beginning of 2021 (I think, memory's broken) and I didn't keep up with the things that changed. I stuck around SMS because I had come to enjoy the people on that server and I am far too shy to go to a different community and start all my rapport building again. However, this soon left me feeling like I wasn't really contributing anything to discussions and I felt that I was dragging down talks about the game. I've also moved on to a completely different type of game and want to be a part of that community so leaving would leave me either really bored or moving on to other discords in the future.

So, with that being said, the main reason I left was to move on with my life and find some other community to burden with my existence. It's been fun and I appreciate you guys a whole heck of a lot.

# Bad explanation but... Anyway, go find some other femboy to simp over :p
