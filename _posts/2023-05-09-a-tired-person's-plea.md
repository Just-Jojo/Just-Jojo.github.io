# Observation
Pain, suffering, happiness, sorrow, death, pleasure, the feelings of a world stricken by life, bustling about, going hither and yond. Is it right to wish for the pain to end? To be a mere observer of this beautiful world hidden away by the struggles of day to day life?
O, to be an observer of the universe, merely watching the oddities and wonders of this marvelous universe we have found ourselves in. To feel nothing, no pain, no sorrow, no heartbreak, no happiness, no pleasure, no sense of fulfillment. What use has an observer for these things?

Is it better to brave the ups and downs that come and go as they please, sticking around way further than they aught, leaving lasting consequences on life, or is this bleak, pointless state of watching the world a goal that should be expounded upon?

# Plea of a broken, weary soul
A machine, feeling every cog and lever aching and moaning from constant use, never speaking up or crying. Push forwards, just like its always done. What else is there to do? Push, no matter how much pain it puts itself through.
Restless, a tired shell of a person who's worked themselves to death, wanting release from these aches and hardships and yet not being able to find any.
It hurts so much, and yet, there's nothing to do besides it.

The call of the tormentor, so frightening and yet, the only thing I've known. Life without seems much scarier than what I know will happen if I go back. If I do go back, at least I know what'll happen every day, even if it hurts, burns, it would still be better than the uncertainty of outside.

## I am very tired :(
