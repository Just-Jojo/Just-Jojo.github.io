# Lycoris Recoil and why Reddit will kill me
Lycoris Recoil is a pretty fun anime. Cute girls with guns is (almost) always a good time and the premise seems to be rather nice.

The main characters, Chisato and Takina, are pretty good at what they do (probably) and have an interesting dynamic, with Takina being cold and following the rules for the most part and Chisato being a chatoic goofball. However, it is heavily implied that their relationship is gonna be something more than just friends :catworry:.

Enter Reddit's WholesomeYuri subreddit. A pretty nice place filled with fan art of ships of different anime and manga girls. Yeah, this fucking subreddit hurt for about 3 weeks due to the amount of Lycoris Recoil fan art there was. Sure, it was nice to look at and go "aw, they look lovely together" but it hurt like a bitch because I thought that it would never happen in the anime...

~~Until episode 4~~

Yeah, this episode was the saving grace for me. Sure, at the beginning it was kinda sus but the episode was really cute with them basically going on a date (headcannon go brrrrr). Sure, the fan art still stings a little bit but now I have hope that the show will actually go that direction.

If you have already, go watch Lycoris Recoil; it's pretty fun.

~~also fuck you JBP, go watch it~~
