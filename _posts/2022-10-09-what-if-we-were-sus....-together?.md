# What if we were sus.... together?
This is gonna be about Berserk and why I love manga so if you were expecting amogus then you are gonna be sad.

Berserk is a pretty fun, very brutal manga, showing some of the coolest scenery and art alongside some of the worst actions a person can do to another. It also happens to have a very hot progtagonist (but that's not important). Guts is a scarred, broken man and his only want and desire is to swing his sword and kill some idiots on the battlefield.

Without spoiling the story too much he is one of the strongest character in the story by only being human and carrying a massive fucking sword.

And shall we discuss aforementioned sword? It was much too big to be called a sword. Massive, thick, heavy and far too rough. Indeed, it was like a heap of raw iron. A sword built and designed to slay dragons, thought to be impossible to wield by the master blacksmith responsible for the weapon, it was an insane work of art that would have seen no action or kills had it not been for some ripped, broken man.

Anyway, the story is super interesting and is very dark so if you like medieval-style fantasy and super dark, deplorable stuff then this manga is gonna be... decent for you.

Also the art is super amazing, double page spreads are literally sex honestly.

# Anyway have fun :)
