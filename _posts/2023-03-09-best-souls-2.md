# Best Souls 2
Dark Souls 2 is probably one of the Dark Souls games that has "2" in its name.
It's widely considered to be a game made by Fromsoftware.

Of course, it is also regarded as a pretty decent game with some minor and some *major* (adp) issues and weird design choices, however, one decision I will never forgive Fromsoft for is the lack of decent fashion in the game.

Now, now, put down your pitchforks and listen to me for a while. The maiden set, which is featured in every other Dark Souls game, **does not exist** in Dark Souls 2. Why? Probably because the b-team hates everyone who plays the game. "Oh, but Jojo," I hear you say, "the Dingy Set exists!" And that is true. It certainly does exist. In NG+. In ***TRUE*** NG+. Meaning you cannot burn a bonfire ascetic and get the Dingy Set in the first NG cycle.

Every other set in the game either is sorta ugly or is so far into the game that I'd spend longer getting to it than actually using it (looking at you, Travler's Set. Send me to the fucking Haligtree, would ya?)

Anyway, this is a very minor issue and the game is still somewhat playable and pretty fun honestly (although I have no clue as to why)
