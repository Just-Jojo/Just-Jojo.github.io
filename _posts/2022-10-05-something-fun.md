# something fun
The ancient evils and tongues of those foolish enough to persue the folly of their teachings were banished some time ago by someone far wiser, yet more mortal than ourselves. The frail, old, false god that abandoned his people sits on a hollow throne, daydreaming of a time when he was once respected and feared, now a decrepit, lowly shell of a person that once was, he waits, longing for the sweet, out of reach kiss of the fair lady death to once more grace his presence.

The banished shall once more rise up from the labouring fields and take homes and raise families, only for the cycle to once more start again. The long, weary, and lonesome road that travelers walk is lined with rows of dead men's bones, once called weak but perhaps the strongest of the creatures of this broken world.

At the end of the road, if an end there may be, is a tree, burned and scorned by the nameless god, its white bark shining in the sun. Those who have seen it and have kissed its once noble limbs are said to receive blessings by the lord of the sea, a mighty warrior whose battles a numerous but losses are greater. Whether this blessing brings the traveler good fortune or casts an eternal shadow upon their soul is neither known nor written about, either by the children of this generation or the fallen.
