# Been a while!

I haven't really been writing blogs just because... I became very busy and I have no ideas on what to blog about!

I've recently started to work, which has been wonderful. It's given me something to do for some money and has gotten me to be less depressed overall which is always a good thing.

Next, ideas. Ideas are terrible. I haven't been able to sit down and work on something code related or even related to this blog in a while just because I haven't had any ideas.

# Will I be around more?

Maybe.

I have no real idea or plan on what I'm going to do but I hope to get some more blog posts out soon-ish

# Other things

I don't have anything for this... uhhhh

Just have a good day :)
