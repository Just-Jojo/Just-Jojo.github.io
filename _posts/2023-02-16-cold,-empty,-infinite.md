# Cold, empty, infinite
It just... goes on forever...

There's nothing, not a person, nor creature, not even a fucking fly here. Walking, aimlessly. For what, I don't know, but there's just the empty expanse of the cold, dark universe. Months in one direction, an hour in another, what difference does it make?

I come here every once in a while, randomly, whenever things are looking hopeful I am suddenly dragged back here, once more, to wander.

Voices, drifting in and out. Louder, softer, firm and gentle, but all hazy, out of tune.

The worst of the matter is the calming and comfort of the void, stretching infinitely. Lovingly, tenderly, calling me its beloved, clasping me in an ice cold, yet ever so warm embrace.

Sunlight. I've snapped out of it again and am back, just sitting, admiring the view of this weird, fantasical world I've found myself in.

But I'll be back, it's bound to me and I to it.

## Cold, empty, infinite, so sweet and yet... so venomous
