# Saturdays
Ah, Saturdays. The beginning of the weekend, a time that most people love, work is done, school is out, and it's a time to just relax.
Yet, whenever Saturday rolls around I get severely depressed. My motivation drops, I feel like a burden on everyone I interact with, and I just grow tired. Every week, without fail, my mental health tanks on Saturday and doesn't restabilize until Monday.

Anyway, all this to say that I'm gonna start taking breaks from everything every Saturday and Sunday

# I probably need therapy... hope you guys are doing well though :)
