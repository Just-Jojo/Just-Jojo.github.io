# Morbin' time
So uh, I think I've shifted the focus of this blog from me talking about things that probably could help people like, *scoff*, I don't know, ***myself*** and just start shitposting about random things.


I think the fundamental flaw in stories is that they have an end, and that ending is not always what we want to happen (Domestic Girlfriend *cough*), but, end it must for ultimately everything comes to an end whether we wish for that to happen or not. Perhaps the reason why we tell stories is to escape from our bleak, ever devolving and disintegrating world, and to imagine a place where people are actually happy... and sometimes we just want step siblings to fuck.

In my opinion, life is so worthless and uninteresting that there's not much point in doing anything besides coming up with new stories about people and places and things, whether they be happy, sad, horrifying, or dull, and to not imagine a story is to do a disservice to yourself and the world.

The inevitability that the world will someday end and that at some point you will die is such an odd thing to think about. Take, for instance, you, reading this right now. You could be doing 100% better things than reading a stupid blog on the internet like reading manga, watching paint dry, or filing your taxes; but no, you're here. Reading this. Feel proud?

Anyway, all this to say is that your creativity shouldn't be hindered by things like the world saying you're bad at writing. Fuck the world honestly.

But if you write stupid fanfictions on the internet you should feel ashamed of yourself :)

(Also, I may start to write more blogs if I remember this exists soooooo sorry in advanced?)
