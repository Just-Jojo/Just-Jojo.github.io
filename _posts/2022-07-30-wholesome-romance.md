# Wholesome romance
So, wholesome romance. It's pretty fun to watch or read and think how sad and lonely you are. Well, with my months and years of reading and watching some really vile stuff on the internet, I am no longer able to consume romances without experiencing massive amounts of pain.

It's not like the romance is bad or anything, the characters are lovable and cute and it has decent art. No, it just doesn't have anything... *bad* happen in it.
I've gotten so used to characters being broken on a mental level that functioning, normal people are weird to me.

# Segwaying into my next topic...
I think one of the worst things about starting a manga is eventually catching up to it. I would say I would rather start a manga that's already finished or a manga that only has 2-5 chapters out, that way I either will consume all of the manga or be able to follow along as it gets written.
If I start a manga with like 30 chapters out already it hurts more because I get invested into the story and the characters and then it's suddenly ripped away from me, and I have to wait 1 week to maybe a month for the next chapter (when is the next chapter of SBD coming out :( ).

For example, reading Chainsaw Man was fine because I knew it was already over so I could take my time with it (even though I didn't because I cannot read manga slowly apparently) and be happy when it ended... although the ending wasn't too happy...

The only manga I read that was already over when I started and I didn't feel happy about after reading it was Oyasumi Punpun. Oyasumi Punpun is very, very heavy and deals with a lot of uncomfortable subjects.
Oyasumi Punpun is the only piece of media that I have blocked memories of it so I don't have to deal with the pain.

If you do decide to read it (which I do not recommend honestly) don't read it in a bad mental state, it will fuck you.

# Joj, it's been like 3 days, where have you been tbh?
Yeah, yeah, I haven't made a post in a few days and that's due to me: A) not having a topic to discuss and B) going outside to touch grass (and seeing a giant horse cock)
I'll *probably* try to make a few more blog posts in the following week but idk if I will.

Cya later or whatever and thanks for reading you masochists :)
