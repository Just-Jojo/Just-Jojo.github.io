## What is this?
So, since I knew that github allows users to have a blogsite using github.io and github pages, I decided to make this. I don't know how much longer this will be around but eh, might as well have some fun

## What will this be about?
I don't know yet. I'll probably have some posts about what I'm doing with my Discord bots and probably other coding things I've done.
