# Sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows
How often have you hung out with friends or had to sit and listen to your parents lecture you about something you absolutely didn't do?
How many times have you thought "Wow, this person that I hold near and dear to me could just vanish when I leave and I'll never see or hear from them again"?

Despite the countless advancements made by humanity, death is still something we cannot control, it can strike at any moment and it leaves heartbreak in its wake.
Accidents, whether by man or by nature, happen, and there is nothing we can do to prevent most of them.

At any moment, you, or one of the people you know and maybe love dearly, could be taken away, never to be seen or heard of again. So, make sure the conversation you have with that person wouldn't be something you would regret if they were to suddenly pass away, as you will never be able to reconcile with them.

## Have a good day or night :)
