# Bloggin' time
I think having a blog is pretty fun because you can ramble about anything into the air and no one will be able to see it (unless they do). It's like talking to yourself but it's not as weird.

I've been meaning to record some sort of podcast thing but every time I go to record it I just fail. Of course, with the way a lot of people reacted when I sent videos of just me talking I think I could say absolutely anything and people would throw themselves at my feet begging for more :catworry:

# Shifting tones to something else
I recently realized that I don't really care for playing video games like Minecraft. Sure, I'll have fun watching other people play it, but I'm content to just stay on the sidelines and just smile as people have fun. This also (probably) ties in to my love of romance mangas and animes in some way; I'm content to watch someone else fall in love with another person, and just smile and wave at them whilst remaining alone (happily, might I add).

## Dunno what else to say here so... I'm morb'd to see you
