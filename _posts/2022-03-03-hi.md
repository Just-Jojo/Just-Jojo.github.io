# Hi

So, uh, hi.

It's been a while... *again*

To be entirely honest, I have not felt up to doing much of anything for a long time. I've struggled with mental issues for a bit now but I've gotten to a semi-decent state now.
I've also not had any ideas for quite a while. I've felt creatively drained for quite a bit and I've had nothing to share or talk about for a while.

Whilst I won't make any promises, I'll probably be blogging a lot more, just saying random stuff like I should've done for a while.

Ramblings about language, thoughts about the world, and lessons about things that ultimately don't matter will come soon(:tm:).


## Thanks for reading :D
