# June
Yada yada, it's been a while, whatever.

Welp, it's June, and that means it's pride month! Which is nice and all but I really can't be arsed to actually care that much.
It's not that I don't like LGBTQ people (hell, I'm one of them lmfao) it's just that I would rather be quiet and live in peace than go and do stuff.

My mental health has.... not been great, but it never really has been. The constant pressure of life weighing down on me and my realizations of who I am and how it goes against what my family and everyone else in my life think has not been great on my already shaky mental state.
I am usually in a constant state of up and down when it comes to my depression. Dipping into it for a couple of days and then being fine for a few more. Every once in a while it'll be really good, or really bad, for a couple of weeks and then back to the up and down.

Wish I could get therapy or talk to literally anyone but fuck me I guess.

## Happy pride and have fun :3
