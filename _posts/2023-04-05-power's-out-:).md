# Power's out :)
My power is currently out, so uh.... fun.


Today, I'm gonna be talking about sexual education and why it helps.
Proper sex ed is something that old people don't want being taught to our kids for... some reason?
Abstinence is something they claim to want for their kids, which is fine and all, but you can have sex ed while abstaining from sex. Proper sexual education has been shown to reduce STDs, teenage pregnancy, child sexual abuse, prevent a bunch of other things. It also helps people to see each other as people, instead of objects.

Now, I get that parents don't want their children to be exposed to sex until they are older, however it is better for the future generation if they learn how to have safe sex compared to if they don't. The amount of good proper sexual education can do far outweighs whatever the parents think. Unless the children are being forced to participate in sexual activities, or are being sexually abused, there should be nothing wrong with explaining how the human body works.

Christians are mostly against sexual education in schools, whether that be because they think sex is evil or because of bigotry towards the LGTBQ community. They also have a large problem with covering up sexual abuse and allegations, and treating victims of those crimes like shit because it was a "sin" on their part as well :)
(I am 100% going to talk about my gripes with Christianity at some point, but I don't wanna atm)

Regardless, parents who bitch and moan about schools wanting to teach proper, safe sex to kids probably don't realize that even though their kids won't be told about it now, they will find out eventually.
The internet is an amazing place, filled with tons of information on nearly any niche subject you can think about, and even those you have never even imagined before. It also has a **TON** of porn. Kids are curious, and if they have heard about this thing called "sex" and are told they don't need to know about it now, they will go looking for information about it, and due to how easy it is to find things nowadays, they will find it.
The problem with them finding it on the internet compared to being taught about it in school is that the content on the internet is, for the most part, not designed in an educational manor, and is instead for entertainment.
As such, ideas that are important to the health of both parties are not communicated properly, and can leave the child improperly educated about how it works.
Maybe this wouldn't be such a bad thing, however because sex has been held away from them for so long, and they just found out about it, they will want to preform it, leading to STDs, teenage pregnancies, etc.

(Or they could just be like "lmao, wtf are they doing" and find out they're asexual)

Proper sexual education helps explain what sex is, how to keep you and your partner safe, and helps people understand how our bodies work (menstruation cycles are also a taboo subject for... some reason? And that's kinda shitty)

While it can seem like a bad thing and "What about our children!!!", a proper sexual education can, and most likely will, help your children more than if they don't have one.
