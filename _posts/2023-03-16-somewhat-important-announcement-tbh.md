# Somewhat important announcement tbh
I'm kinda shit about talking about things like this, but sure.

I'm coming out as trans.

That's the gist of it. I won't be able to actually do anything like HRT or surgery (though I'm not sure if I even want surgery at the moment) mostly due to my current living situation, but I'll be presenting as fem online.

Not a whole lot is gonna change about the way I talk or do stuff online (except no vc, darn), just me being more comfortable with who I am.

Respect it, don't, I don't give a shit. I'm just gonna do what I think is best for me and figure shit out as I go along

# :3 love you

also also, I have a discord server in case you fuckers missed me and wanted to talk to me, nothing too impressive but sure
