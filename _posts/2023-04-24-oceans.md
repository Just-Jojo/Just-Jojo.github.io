# Oceans
Take a deep breath. In. And out. Feel the calm wash over you, just like the beauty of the cruel mistress that is the ocean, constantly churning, up and down, calm and rage, peace and chaos.
The wind, whether a cunning trickster or an unaware child plays, tossing back and forth, the waves, high or low, rock the boat. Whether gentle or rough, the ocean remains fickle, changing on a whim, acting so kind, then so cruel.
Just like life, it rocks, up and down, calm and chaotic. Go along with it, see what is has to offer. You are your own captain and yet you are so out of control, held to the mercy of a force you can never hope to understand.

The sun, maddeningly bright, sinks below, kissing the cool water with a crimson goodbye. The moon, as peaceful and beautiful as when first we met, dances over the raging waters. A waltz so majestic and so deadly, it brings a tear to my eye.
A life without the ocean is no life at all.

# Oh, and shorks are pretty cool too :p
