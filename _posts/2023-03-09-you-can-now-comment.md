# You can now comment
Hi there, you may notice a thing below here that says "Sign in to comment" or "Leave a comment".

Do not be alarmed! Your eyes are not playing tricks on you (probably).

I've added a comment function for all my blog posts so you can ~~leave nice comments and say hi~~ make fun of me if you want.
You'll need a github account but that's easy tbh

# Have fun :3
